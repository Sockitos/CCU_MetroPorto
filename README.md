# User Centered Design - Metro do Porto
PocketMetro is a two-part solution for the Metro do Porto problem: a mobile app to feature a redesigned and simpler user-interface, as well as the inclusion of a new “milestone" / loyalty system; and a tagging camera assisted mechanism that can identify a person and a receiver that checks if the card is emitting any signal that says it's validated.
